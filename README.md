### Purpose
InMemory, works toward the Maker track and the Healthcare overlay. This project relates to the Tech for Good theme by using technology to support grieving individuals. It was developed using Swift and SwiftUI, with Firebase Firestore and Storage for storing journal entries, memorial details, and a shared candle. Canva was used for creating graphics.

**Ethics**:
This project is intentionally ethical in many ways. This app strives to protect users' data and confidentiality by storing each memorial in a secure cloud platform. Users also have control over who they share their memorials with their unique memorial PIN. To prevent harm within our project, we provide users with resources on grieving. To be inclusive of our usersâ€™ diverse cultural and personal beliefs surrounding grief and loss, we provide them with an open ended writing page where they can express themselves however they wish.

### Project Description
A recent study found that 57% of Americans are grieving the loss of someone close to them over the last three years.. We developed InMemory to offer a space for grieving individuals to remember and reflect on their loved ones, anywhere. Our project aims to provide comfort and connection by facilitating the sharing of stories and memories. In the future, we plan to enhance InMemory with more personalized memorial pages and virtual support group chats. Ultimately, our goal is to alleviate feelings of isolation and reduce the stigma surrounding grief and mental health issues.

### How it Works
Users can create a virtual memorial for a loved one.  By clicking the edit icon, they can edit details like name, birthday, and photos and get a shareable PIN. In the main window, users customize by lighting a candle, changing the sky/flower colors with taps. Users also have a resource window through the lightbulb icon that shares coping strategies of grief published from the NIH. There is also a journaling area that can be a collaborative experience if they wish. By entering the same PIN, others can join and modify the same memorial, sharing notes and lighting the candle together, regardless of location.
